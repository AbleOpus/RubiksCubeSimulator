## Using The Application

The application presents the rubiks cube in 2D by unfolding it. The back face is unfolded to the right. The color strip at the bottom enables one to set the cube to a scrambled state. 

1. Set the color configuration of the cube if you wish to work on an unsolved cube state. To do this, you must uncheck the color lock button. Then pick colors from the color strip and click on the specific cubes to set them — repeat this until the desired state is replicated.

2. Lock the color strip. This will allow you to rotate sides using the mouse buttons.

3. Right-click a face to rotate it clockwise. Left-Click for CCW. You may also type algorithms in the provided TextBox. Press enter to submit an agorithm. Valid algorithms are: R, Ri, L, Li, F, Fi, B, Bi, U, Ui, D, Di. Algorithms can be seperated by a space and or a comma.

Note: The cube state is automatically persisted.

I also tried to implement incremental solving — I was unable to figure it out.
